# PSP
Hi,I am Nithin.This repository includes all the Projcts and practice I have done in my problem solving with python(PSP) course where I did Projects from Scratch,Raptor and Python.
Python and Raptor have seperate folders and coming to scratch i have done in offline scartch(sb3) and uploaded in the master repository which have all common files.


Course Syllabus:-
Unit I: Computational Thinking and Visual Programming Concepts
Introduction to computational thinking. Visual programming concepts. Scratch environment: sprites -- appearance and motion, angles and directions, repetition and variation, changing costumes, adding a background. Input/Output, variables, and operators.


Unit II:  Algorithms and Flowchart design through Raptor
Introduction to the idea of an algorithm. Pseudocode and Flow charts. Flow chart symbols, Input/Output, Assignment, operators, conditional if, repetition, procedure, and sub-charts. Example problems – Finding maximum of 3 numbers, Unit converters, Interest calculators, multiplication tables, GCD of 2 numbers Example problem -- Fibonacci number generation, prime number generation. Minimum, Maximum, and average of n numbers, Linear search, BinarySearch.


Unit III: Introduction to Python
Python – Numbers, Strings, Variables, operators, expressions, statements, String operations, Math function calls, Input/Output statements, Conditional If, while and for loops, User-defined Functions, parameters to functions, recursive functions, Turtle Graphics.


Unit IV: Data Structures and Idiomatic Programming in Python
Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Strings, Files, and their libraries. Beautiful Idiomatic approach to solve programming problems.


Unit V: Packages
Numpy -- Create, reshape, slicing, operations such as min, max, sum, search, sort, math functions, etc. 
Pandas -- Read/write from csv, excel, json files, add/ drop columns/rows, aggregations, applying functions 
Matplotlib -- Visualizing data with different plots, use of subplots.
User-defined packages, define test cases, and perform unit testing


Experiments:
1.Design a script in Scratch to make a sprite to draw geometrical shapes such as Circle, Triangle, Square, Pentagon. 
2.Design a script in Scratch to make a sprite to ask the user to enter two different numbers and an arithmetic operator and then calculate and display the result.
3.Design a Memory Game in Scratch which allows the user to identify positions of similar objects in a 3 x 3 matrix.
Construct flowcharts to 

a. calculate the maximum, minimum and average of N numbers

b. develop a calculator to convert time, distance, area, volume and temperature from one unit to another.

4.Construct flowcharts with separate procedures to

a. calculate simple and compound interest for various parameters specified by the user

b. calculate the greatest common divisor using iteration and recursion for two numbers as specified by the user 

5.Construct flowcharts with procedures to 

a. generate first N numbers in the Fibonacci series

b. generate N Prime numbers

6.Design a flowchart to perform Linear search on list of N unsorted numbers (Iterative and recursive) 

7.Design a flowchart to perform Binary search on list of N sorted numbers (Iterative and recursive)

8.Design a flowchart to determine the number of characters and lines in a text file specified by the user 

9.Design a Python script to convert a Binary number to Decimal number and verify if it is a Perfect number. 

10.Design a Python script to determine if a given string is a Palindrome using recursion

11.Design a Python script to sort numbers specified in a text file using lists.

12.Design a Python script to determine the difference in date for given two dates in YYYY:MM:DD format (0 <= YYYY <= 9999, 1 <= MM <= 12, 1 <= DD <= 31) following the leap year rules.

13.Design a Python Script to determine the Square Root of a given number without using inbuilt functions in Python.

14.Design a Python Script to determine the time difference between two given times in HH:MM: SS format. (0 <= HH <= 23, 0 <= MM <= 59, 0 <= SS <= 59)

15.Design a Python Script to find the value of (Sine, Cosine, Log, PI, e) of a given number using infinite series of the function.

16.Design a Python Script to convert a given number to words

17.Design a Python Script to convert a given number to a roman number.

18.Design a Python Script to generate the frequency count of words in a text file.

19.Design a Python Script to print a spiral pattern for a 2 dimensional matrix. 

20.Design a Python Script to implement Gaussian Elimination method.

21.Design a Python script to generate statistical reports (Minimum, Maximum, Count, Average, Sum etc) on public datasets.

22.Design a Python script using the Turtle graphics library to construct a turtle bar chart representing the grades obtained by N students read from a file categorizing them into distinction, first class, second class, third class and failed.

I Completed This course under the guidance of Ladi Sandeep Kumar Sir.
